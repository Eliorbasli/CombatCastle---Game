Hello,


thank you for buying this Glock 19 Prefab.





How to set it up ?


I guess, you want to use the gun wuth you character ?

Example of the Glock setup with an arm:



- Place the Glock 19 in the scene next to the hand and bring it in the right position, like you want to have it.



- After that drag the whole Glock prefab into your character model(not the Bone itself, as exmaple -> Player/Glock).




- Then put the "Glock19_rigged" into the action bone, like the hand of you character and if yo uwant to animate it, click on the player main bone and click o nthe button window in the unity editor and then on animation to create one.



- you Glock is animated, now you can use it.



 Here is a you tube video how to set the glock up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1au9iWYUJI&feature=youtu.be 

 
 The texture size is 1800x1800
 Include are a texture and a normal map.


  The Glock 19 model has this follow materials:


  "Weapon_main" = The main boy of the weapon.

  "scope_aimming" = if you aim with the Glock see you that white-painted meshes, there you can change how it should looks, as example that it should glow a bit.


  2 x "Bullet_in_magazine" = If you magazine is empty in you game and you put it out, it looks bad if a bullet case is in, so you can disappear it with visible material.
